# Gemini Project Analysis: Visualizador 360

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated, single-page web application designed as a presentation tool for showcasing 360-degree panoramic images to clients. It is built using a modern frontend toolchain centered around Vite.

**Key Features:**

-   **Interactive 360° Viewer:** Utilizes the `@photo-sphere-viewer/core` library for a high-quality viewing experience.
-   **Dynamic Gallery:** The side gallery is not hardcoded. It is dynamically generated by reading the contents of the image directory.
-   **Retractable Menu:** The side gallery is collapsible to allow for an immersive, fullscreen viewing experience.
-   **Light/Dark Theme:** A theme switcher allows toggling between light and dark modes, with the preference saved in the user's browser via `localStorage`.
-   **Custom Branding:** Incorporates a custom logo with a color scheme that adapts to the selected theme.

**Architecture:**

The application is a static site powered by Vite. A key architectural feature is the use of a Node.js script (`generate-list.js`) during development. This script scans the `public/images/360` directory and creates a `gallery-data.json` file. The client-side JavaScript then fetches this JSON file to dynamically build the gallery, decoupling the image data from the application logic.

**Core Technologies:**

-   **Build Tool:** Vite
-   **Core Logic:** Plain HTML, CSS, and modern JavaScript (ES Modules)
-   **360° Viewer:** `@photo-sphere-viewer/core`
-   **3D Engine:** `three.js` (as a dependency of the viewer)
-   **Dependency Management:** NPM

## Building and Running

This project has a development workflow that includes generating an image list before running the server.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    If this is the first time running the project or after cloning it, install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Update Image List (Important):**
    Whenever you add, remove, or rename images in the `public/images/360` folder, you **must** run this command to update the gallery:
    ```bash
    npm run generate
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    To start the Vite development server and view the application in your browser, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Build for Production:**
    To create a final, optimized version of the site for deployment, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    The output will be placed in a `dist` folder.

## Development Conventions

-   **Project Structure:** Standard Vite `vanilla` project structure.
-   **Static Assets:** All public assets, including images (`/images/360`), favicons, and the generated `gallery-data.json`, must be placed in the `public` directory.
-   **Styling:** Global styles are located in `style.css` and are imported directly into `main.js`. The project uses CSS Custom Properties (variables) for easy theming.
-   **Image Workflow:** The single source of truth for the gallery's content is the `public/images/360` directory. After modifying its contents, always run `npm run generate`.
